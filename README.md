Token Contract - TKN
This repository contains a simple ERC-20 token contract built using Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries.

Overview
This smart contract implements a standard ERC-20 token named Token with the ticker symbol TKN. It leverages OpenZeppelin's trusted library for ERC-20 and includes ownership functionality.

Features
ERC-20 standard: This token follows the ERC-20 standard and can be integrated with any dApp or DeFi platform supporting this standard.
Ownable: The contract uses OpenZeppelin's Ownable feature to grant control over administrative functions to the initial owner.
Token Minting: Tokens are minted using the issueToken() function, which can only be called by the contract owner.

pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

// Declare Contract.
// Rename Accordingly.

contract Token is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC20("Token", "TKN")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}
  
    // Mention The Total Supply For Ticker.

    function issueToken() public {
        _mint(msg.sender, 10000 * 10**18);
    }
}


Dependencies
The contract uses the following dependencies from OpenZeppelin:

ERC20.sol: Implements the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens.
Ownable.sol: Provides ownership control to the contract, restricting sensitive functions to the contract's owner.
Minting Function
The issueToken() function mints 10,000 TKN tokens to the callerâ€™s wallet.
Each token has 18 decimal places.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/token-contract.git
cd token-contract
Install dependencies via npm or yarn:
bash
Copy code
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
Compile the smart contract:

Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Usage
To deploy the contract on a testnet like Sepolia or localhost:

Add your network configuration in hardhat.config.js.

Deploy the contract by running:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
Use the contract address to interact with it, either through Remix, a frontend dApp, or a blockchain explorer like Etherscan.
